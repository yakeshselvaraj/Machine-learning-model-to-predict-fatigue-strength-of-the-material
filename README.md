# Machine-learning-model-to-predict-fatigue-strength-of-the-material
In this project we build a machine learning model to predict the fatigue strength using the Fatigue Dataset for Steel from National Institute of Material Science (NIMS) Mat Navi. Data driven approach have been used to arrive at correlation between various properties of alloys and their composition. K Fold cross validation method has been used to extract the performance evaluation metrics for each model. We were provided with different data analytics tools for predicting the fatigue strength of steels, The data has several features that are mainly categorized into Chemical Composition, Mill Product Features, and Heat Treatment parameters of various steel grades. We are provided with seven different approaches out of which we use four and come up with best and most efficient of the four approaches. Finally, we do a scatter plot for predicted vs actual fatigue strength data to see which performs better.
